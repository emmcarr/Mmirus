All mitogenomes were aligned using MAFFT v.7.388 [1] with M. bidens, M. ginkgodens and M. europaeus as outgroups, M. mirus’s most closely related species[2]. 
The 12s rRNA, 16s rRNA and 13 protein-coding mitochondrial genes were extracted, and individually aligned. Stop codons in coding genes were manually removed in Geneious Prime 2020.1.2 (https://www.geneious.com/). 
The final alignments were concatenated into a combined alignment and substitution models were inferred with PartitionFinder v.2.1.1[3]. 
There were eight subsets (see: 1.2.3 partitions.csv) which were adjusted to fit the BEAUTi v.2.5.2[65] XML file generator and linked with a relaxed clock log normal and a linked Yule tree model. 
Three MRCA node priors were implemented based on fossil evidence [23] (see 1.2.2 node calibrations). The MCMC model was implemented in BEAST2 v.2.5.2[4] with 15 million chains and sampled every 1,500 steps. 
The model was run three separate times to ensure convergence. The log files were inspected with Tracer v.1.7.1(https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/tag/v1.7.1) and combined with LogCombiner v.2.5.2 after a 10% burn-in. 
The tree files were combined after a 10% burn-in with LogCombiner and a Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree was generated with TreeAnnotator v.2.4.2 [5]. 
The final MCC tree was visualised in FigTree v.1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
